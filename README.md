# Doctor Win

## Summary
A small, fun project written in C and C++ during college days while playing with Windows internal structures and tweaking user experiences. This was written in the days when many viruses or worms used to flood our Windows XP system from external USB drives, and multiple Windows features used to get disabled or misbehaved. The code mostly uses batch commands and interacts with the Windows registry.

## Features
- Enable task manager
- Restore quick launch
- Enable folder option
- Enable registry tools
- Fix show all hidden files
- Fix drive opening problems
- Add image to folder background 
- Clean system cache and temporary files
- Folder lock using NTFS locking mechanism

## Archiving
It was originally written in 2007 and pushed to github for archieving purposes in mid 2017 from an old hard disk. In early 2024, it feels quite nostalgic to look back at this code while writing this readme file. This was my first hobby project, which I built passionately.
